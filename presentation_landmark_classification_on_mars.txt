Hi my name is Alvaro Mendizabal and I'm a Data Scientist with the Image Science and Analysis Group. 
I'm happy to be here today in front of you fine people at NASA to share our work on Landmark Identification on Mars

We gathered about 65K images taken by a camera called HiRISE. 
It's aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbirter and it's superpowerful
The images are seperated into 8 different classes or types. Here are some stunning versions of them.

Dark dune and bright dune are 2 sand dune classes on Mars. 
Dark dunes are completely defrosted, 
and bright dunes are typically bright due to overlying frost. 
Black spots can be seen where parts of the dune are defrosting.

We can also included craters. They're rather easy to spot. 

Another class is slope streaks. They're these dark flow-like features on slopes. 
Scientists believe these features were formed by a dry process in which overlying (bright) 
dust tumbles down a slope and expose a darker sub-surface.

Our 5th class is impact ejecta. It's actually material that's blasted out from a volcano eruption or meteorite impact. 
They also include cases in which the impact cleared away overlying dust, revealing the underlying surface. 
In some cases, the crater isn't visible because it's too small to see. 
Impact ejecta may also include lava that poured out from the impact (blobby ("lobate") rather than blast-like), 
more like an eruption (triggered by the impact). 
Impact ejecta can be isolated, or they can form in batches when the impactor breaks up into numerous pieces.

The next 2 classes are spiders and swiss cheese. They're phenomena that occur in the south polar region of Mars. 
Spiders have a central pit with radial troughs, and could be formed due to sublimation of carbon dioxide ice. 
This process can create mineral deposits on top, which resemble light or dark dust that highlights cracks 
in the CO2 ice. 

Swiss cheese is a landmark type that includes pits that are formed when the sun heats the ice 
causing sublimation (change from solid to gas).

Other is a catch-all class that contains images that don't fit into any of the classes.

Two weeks ago, NASA smashed it's Dart probe into an asteroid, destroying itself in the process. 
This is a feed from the probe right before impact 
The collision was intentional and designed to test whether space rocks that might threaten 
Earth could be pushed safely out of the way. 
Reports indicate that the Dart probe was a mere 17 meters off the exact centre of the asteroid. 

Reaching these cosmic milestones remind us that NASA is capable of traveling further than they ever have, 
navigating to specific locations, and capturing photos, recording video and taking samples.

But, "Houston, we have a problem." And it's that there aren't enough scientists to review all the 
collected images and classify them. We at Image Science and Analysis Group (ISAG) have built a model that 
"takes one giant leap" over this problem.

Our model has performed very well on unseen data. 
We can predict 8 different landmark types on Mars with 91.4% accuracy. This work could directly contribute 
to mapping out the terain on Mars. Sort of like a Mars google maps. 
Additionally, we can also identify other unclassifiable landmarks or features. 
The images classified as other may foster efforts to select sites of interest to explore 
during manned or unnmanned missions.

Most importantly we made the model accessible! We made an app. 
You drop in a image and the app will identify the different landmarks in the image. 
When the app identifies a landmark it draws a colored box around the landmark. 
We can tell which landmark it is because each landmark has been assigned a unique color. 
As you can see we have dark dunes, slope streaks, and swiss cheese mapped out in this image
The app promises to be an efficient and effective classifying tool.

This app can be used by everyday people who are curious about Mars too. 
It's educational, interactive and interesting.
Imagine classrooms across the country first learning about NASA and space using our Mars Google Maps.

At it's core, our model let's us know 
what we're looking at and if doesn't then it lures to a new place we could go. 
In this way, image science is part and parcel of space exploration and discovery and 
our group can help NASA further this mission.

Before I go, I'd like to give a special thanks to 
Alec, Ashli, Ben, Charles, Charlie, Garrett, Jordan, Kelly, and Kevin.
Y'all helped me learn throughout the bootcamp. I'm really proud of y'all too. We still have lots to do. Let's get these jobs!
